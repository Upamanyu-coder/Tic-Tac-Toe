# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe (with Rolling 3-Move Logic)

This is a modern twist on the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe game**, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Each player is only allowed to have **3 active moves on the board at any time**. Once a player places their 4th move, their **oldest move disappears**, making it a fun and strategic variation!

---

## 🧠 Features

- 🔁 **Rolling 3-Move Logic**: Each player can only keep 3 moves on the board.
- ✨ **Confetti Celebration**: A colorful confetti animation plays when someone wins.
- 🎨 Responsive and clean UI with `styles.css`.
- 🔄 Restart button to reset the game easily.
- 🧩 Win detection logic with pattern matching.
- ♻️ Smooth cell updates and visual effects for winning cells.

## 🎯 How It Works

* Game board is a 3x3 grid.
* Each player (X and O) can only have 3 pieces on the board at a time.
* Once 4th move is made by a player:

  * The **oldest move is removed** automatically.
* Win detection still applies to current board state only.
* Fun **confetti animation** celebrates the winner.

---

## ✨ Future Enhancements (Ideas)

* Add scoreboard tracking wins and draws.
* Add sound effects for moves and win/draw.
* Make it multiplayer online with sockets.
* Add AI mode to play against computer.
